<h1>!---- Dice Pig Game ----!</h1>
<p>"Dice Pig" is a simple yet addictive dice game where players roll a pair of dice to accumulate points. The objective is to reach a predetermined score without rolling a "1" on either die, which ends the turn and forfeits all accumulated points for that round.<br>
Players can choose to keep rolling to amass more points or pass to secure their current score. It's a game of risk and strategy, as players balance the chance of scoring big with the threat of losing it all. With its quick gameplay and element of luck, "Dice Pig" promises fun and excitement for all ages.</p>
